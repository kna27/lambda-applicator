    1. 100: Passes all unit tests I created, all the tests in the lab instruction document, all the tests in the Scoring Sheet, and the Extra Credit tests
    2. 100: Had other assessments, classwork, and applications for internships but still managed to complete the lab on time
    3. 100: Worked towards a complete project with clean and maintainable code and an organized project structure
    4. 100: Did not have a partner for this lab and completed it independently
f. I have worked hard to create unit tests that cover the capabilities of my Lambda Lab and learned how to use Gradle in the process.
    Run them with `./gradlew test` to see the results or see `README.md` for more information. I have strived towards an
    organized project structure and clean code throughout the entirety of creating this project.
